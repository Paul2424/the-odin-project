        <p> 
            Tuo zaafi is a Northern Ghanaian dish made by cooking a 
            combination of maize or millet flour and water. 
            In the Hausa language, tuo means stirred, and zaafi means hot. 
            Sticky, starchy, and full of carbohydrates, 
            tuo zaafi is traditionally served with okra soup.
            </p>
