        <p> 
            McMuffin is a family of breakfast sandwiches sold by the 
            international fast food restaurant chain McDonald's. 
            The Egg McMuffin is the signature sandwich, 
            which was invented in 1972 by Herb Peterson to resemble eggs Benedict, 
            a traditional American breakfast dish with 
            English muffins, ham, eggs and hollandaise sauce.
